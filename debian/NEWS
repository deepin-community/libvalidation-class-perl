libvalidation-class-perl (1.112870-1) unstable; urgency=low

  From the upstream README:  

    Important Note! Validation::Class just got a lot more flexible which came
    at the cost of losing the grouped parameters functionality. AGAIN,
    grouped parameters are no longer supported using the old way of doing
    things. Validation::Class now supports hash
    serialization/deserialization which means that you can now set the
    parameters using a hashref of nested hashrefs and validate against them,
    or set the parameters using a hashref of (serialized)key/(non-ref)value
    pairs and validate against that. This function is provided in
    Validation::Class via Hash::Flatten.
